The **==maximum port number==** that can be assigned to a network service is 65,535. In TCP/IP networking, ports are used to identify specific processes or services running on a device. Port numbers range from 0 to 65,535, with the Well-Known Ports (0-1023) reserved for common services like HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21), and many others. The Registered Ports (1024-49,151) are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for specific applications or protocols. The Dynamic or Private Ports (49,152-65,535) can be used by any application or service without requiring registration.

### ==How Request route to correct Controller:==

In Spring Boot, the internal mapping between the Request Mapping and HTTP requests is handled by the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet acts as the front controller and is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate controller methods based on the Request Mapping configurations.

When an HTTP request is received, the DispatcherServlet analyzes the request URL, HTTP method, and other request attributes to determine the appropriate controller method to handle the request. Here's a high-level overview of how the internal mapping process occurs:

1\. Request Parsing: The DispatcherServlet parses the incoming HTTP request to extract information like the request URL, HTTP method, headers, request parameters, and request body.

2\. Handler Mapping: The DispatcherServlet consults the registered HandlerMappings to determine the controller and method that should handle the request. The HandlerMapping implementations in Spring, such as the RequestMappingHandlerMapping, are responsible for mapping the request to the appropriate handler method.

3\. Handler Execution: Once the DispatcherServlet has identified the appropriate controller and method through the HandlerMapping, it invokes the corresponding controller method, passing the necessary request parameters and attributes.

4\. Controller Processing: The controller method is executed, performing the necessary business logic and generating a response.

5\. Response Handling: The result of the controller method execution is processed and transformed into an HTTP response. This can include mapping the return value of the method to the appropriate HTTP status code, headers, and body.

6\. Rendering the Response: The DispatcherServlet delegates the response rendering to the appropriate ViewResolver and View implementations, which generate the final response to be sent back to the client.

It's important to note that the Request Mapping annotations, such as `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., play a crucial role in defining the mappings between HTTP requests and controller methods. These annotations provide a declarative way to specify the URL patterns, HTTP methods, request parameters, and other criteria for mapping requests to the corresponding controller methods.

Through this internal mapping process, Spring Boot enables developers to define flexible and customizable request handling logic using the Request Mapping annotations and leverage the DispatcherServlet for efficient routing and processing of incoming HTTP requests.
